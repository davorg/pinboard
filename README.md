# pinboard

I've started playing with [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/) and, in particular, its API.
This repo is a dumping ground for anything I write that seems vaguely useful.

I'm largely a Perl programmer, so these programs will mostly be in Perl. I've been using
[WWW::Pinboard](https://metacpan.org/pod/WWW::Pinboard) which is a Perl library that wraps
the API. There's likely a similar library for your favourite language - which will make
translating these programs pretty easy.

Let me know if you find any of this stuff useful. I'm
